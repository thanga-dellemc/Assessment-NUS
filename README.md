For this Assessment on Telco Call record data, to detect scam.
I have done the following with my current knowledge, but could not complete the assessment.
Whole purpose of my application to this training to build this skill on top of my infrastructure/cloud/hybrid cloud experience.

I was able to read data in SQLite and convert to CSV.
I was able to upload data into Github and access through python code.
Split the data into 80% for Training and 20% for Testing.
Split the Data into X , Y
Y = last column to identifiy if scam
X = all other columns
Above steps are towards data preparation.
Then used Linear Regression and RandomForest Models.
Had challenges with String/test Columns in the database.
Got some help from Google Colab and Gemini, still could not run both algorithms with given data inclufing text.
But watched a youtube video using both algorithm with numeric data and successfully deploying training, test, evaluation and plot results.
Used few libraries Panda, Skilearn.
